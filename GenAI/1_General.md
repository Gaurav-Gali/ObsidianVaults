#### Common Terms
1. Corpus
	1. It's the entire text
2. Vocabulary
	1. It's the unique words in the text/corpus, hence the duplicates of the word won't be considered.
3. Document
	1. A single row in the text/corpus.
4. Word
	1. A single word from the text/corpus.

#### What are generative models
- They are the models which can generate new instances of data similar to the training data they were exposed to.
- They learn the underlying pattern and distribution of data, hence making them capable of generative new content resembling the original data.
#### Why generative models are required
- Understand complex models from data.
- Content generation.
- Build powerful application.

#### Discriminative vs Generative Model
1. Discriminative Model
	1. This model can differentiate and predict the possible outcome from the given dataset.
	2. Say, we have a model trained to identify cats. Hence this model will be able to predict if the given input is a cat or not.
2. Generative Model
	1. This model can generate new content based of the trained dataset.
	2. Say, we have a model trained on images of cats. The model will be able to generate a new image of a cat.

#### LLMs
- Large Language Models(LLMs) are foundational machine learning models that use deep learning algorithms to process and understand natural language.
- These models are trained on massive amounts of text data and patterns and entity relationships in the language.
- LLMs are used to perform text to text generation, text to image generation and image to text generations.
- Example : Gemini, GPT, XLM, T5, Llama, Mistral, Falcon etc.
