### Hover

1. To add hover effects to a html element we need to use the *:hover* pseudo-class.
	1. Some other pseudo-classes:
		1.  :active , styles are applied when the current element is active.
2. The opacity property can be used to set the opacity of the current element and the range of of the opacity lies between 0 and 1.

### Transition
1. To add smooth transitions to a html element we need to use the *transition* property.
2. This property takes in a couple of values:
	1. The effect in which the transition would take place.
	2. Duration of the transition
	3. Eg : transition : opacity 0.5s , color 0.25s;

### Shadows
1. To add shadows to a html element we need to use the *box-shadow* property.
2. This property takes a couple of values:
	1. Horizontal placement of shadow
	2. Vertical placement of shadow
	3. Shadow blur ranging from 0 to 1.
	4. Color of the shadow
	5. Eg : box-shadow: 2px 3px 5px \#3d91fa;
3. Ideally for the color value use the *rgba(0 , 0 , 0 ,1 )* to get better results.
