### Inversion of Control (IOC)
1. Usually if a class depends on several other classes to work properly, then it would be difficult to swap out certain dependencies without affecting much of the other dependencies.
2. So tackle this, we make use of dependency injection, where instead of using the classes directly, we make of of a framework instead, like the spring framework.
3. So Spring Boot uses IOC to handle the dependency injections.

### Introduction to Beans
- A bean in Spring is simply an object that is managed by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container.
- The container creates, initializes, and injects these beans where needed.
- Example: If you mark a class with `@Component`, Spring will automatically detect it and create an instance (bean) of it.

### What is @Component
- `@Component` is a Spring annotation used to **mark a class as a Spring-managed bean**.
- When Springâ€™s component scanning runs, it finds all classes annotated with `@Component` and registers them as beans.
```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class MyService {
    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Service running...");
    }
}
```

### Friends of @component
1. @Service : Used for service layer classes (Business logic)
2. @Repository : Used for DAO (**D**ata **A**ccess **O**bjects) level access (Database operations)
3. @Controller : Used for web controller (handles HTTP requests)
4. @RestControlller : A combination of @Controller and @ResponseBody for managing RestAPIs

**Note :** For spring boot we use the ==@SpringBootApplication== annotation to specify the starting point of the beans tree. By this, spring boot will be able to traverse from top to bottom and keep track of all the beans.
There are 3 annotation under this, which include :
1. @Configuration
2. @ComponentScan
3. @EnableAutoConfiguration

**Note :** The @autowired annotation is used to inject a bean created by @component into another class or bean.

```java
package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component  // This class will be registered as a Spring bean
public class Engine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine started!");
    }
}
```

```java
package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component  // Another Spring bean
public class Car {

    private final Engine engine;

    // Constructor Injection (preferred)
    @Autowired
    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public void drive() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car is moving...");
    }
}
```

### Component Scanning
Before running the application, SpringBoot analyses the code and scans for all the beans and components hence keeping track of all of it.
It gives better linting and suggestions for writing better code.
