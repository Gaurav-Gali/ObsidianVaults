### Spring Initializr
- This is a platform where we can setup the spring application and add different dependencies
- Visit [Spring initializ](https://start.spring.io/) to get started with the the setup.

### Spring Framework vs Spring Boot
1. Spring Boot is built on top of the spring framework.
2. Since the Spring framework is highly comprehensive and configurable, it become difficult for rapid development.
3. Spring Boot solves this, by handling most of the configurations in a well documented manner.

### Spring App Layers
1. Persistence Layer
	1. Interacts with the database.
	2. Interacts with the Entities and ==Repositories/DAOs== (**D**ata **A**ccess **O**bjects)
	3. The DAOs handles the CRUD operations.
2. Service Layer
	1. It contains various services, which contains all the business logic of the application.
	2. Data cannot be passed directly from the Persistence layer to the Presentation layer, hence the data must always pass via the Service layer after processing and then to the Presentation layer.
3. Presentation Layer
	1. The purpose of this layer of to access all the services available in the service layer and expose what's required to the user.
	2. This basically contains the API endpoints like RestAPI, GraphQL, Websockets API, Webhooks API etc.

### Maven
It's a tool that helps developers to manage their projects and all the things they need to build their programs.
==It is also used for testing and packaging when needed, with features to distribute our program as an dependency==

***Structure of a maven command*** : ==./mvnw== ==\<phase>== ==\<goal>==

The **mvnw** command
- clean : removes temporary directories and files.
- default : most useful things and goals like running, testing and building the application lies.
- site : documentation is generated.

**Note :** The ./mvnw command can run goals with the options like clean or site, but if we run it without any options it would run under the default option.

1. Goals in maven
	1. compile : compiles your code to bytecode
	2. test : runs unit tests
	3. package : creates a jar or war file
	4. verify : runs checks and integration tests

**Note :**
- Each of the goals happen sequentially. So in order to run the forthcoming command, the previous command must be executed.
- For example , if you want to run the package goal, then the compile and test goals should be executed first.
- If we directly run the package goal, then the compile and test goals will be executed first before running the package goal.

### Maven Project Structure

| Project Structure | Explanation                                          |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| myproject/        | Root project folder                                  |
| ├─ pom.xml        | Project Object Model configuration file              |
| ├─ src/           | Source files                                         |
| │ ├─ main/        | Main application code                                |
| │ │ ├─ java/      | Main Java source code (by packages)                  |
| │ │ ├─ resources/ | Config files, properties, etc.                       |
| │ │ └─ webapp/    | For web apps: HTML, JS, CSS                          |
| │ ├─ test/        | Testing code                                         |

| │ ├─ site/        | Site documentation                                   |
| │ └─ assembly/    | Build/packaging configs (less common)                |
| ├─ target/        | Compiled output (generated by Maven — not committed) |
| └─ .mvn/          | (Optional) Local Maven configuration                 |

### Maven Workflow

**Running the spring boot application**
```bash
./mvnw clean test // Test the program
./mvnw clean package // Packages the program to a jar file

cd target

java -jar <project_name.jar>
```

**Note :** Since the ==verify== goal would execute compile, test, package , we can directly clean and verify in one step.

```bash
./mvnw clean verify
java -jar target/<project_name.jar>
```

#### Running the project using spring-boot plugin in maven
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
**Note** : This directly compiles and verifies the code and run the server.
