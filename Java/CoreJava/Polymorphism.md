What is **polymorphism** ?
- The word *polymorphism* means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.
- ==Polymorphism is considered one of the important features of Object-Oriented Programming. Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways. In other words, polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations. The word “poly” means many and “morphs” means forms, So it means many forms.==

Types of Polymorphism
1. Compile Time (a.k.a) early binding
	1. Example : 
		2. Method overloading ![[Method Overloading]]
2. Run Time (a.k.a) late binding
	1. Example:
		1. Method overriding ![[Method Overriding]]
